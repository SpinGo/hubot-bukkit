hubot-bukkit
============

A [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) script to fetch random(esque) images from Ethan Marcotte's legendary [bukk.it](http://bukk.it). Drop this into your hubot's `/scripts` directory and have a blast doing fun stuff like this:

```
hubot bukkit
```

Hey! That's cool! But what if you want a specific bukk.it?

```
hubot bukkit studiocat
```

Oh my! Does that mean you can see a random selection of the famous "Spidey" GIFs on bukk.it? Let's see:

```
hubot bukkit spidey
```

![Spidey in Narnia](http://bukk.it/spidey-narnia.jpg)

```
hubot bukkit spidey
```

![Spidey yielding to a barrel](http://bukk.it/spidey-barrel.jpg)

Anyway, you get the picture.

## FAQ

### Wait, aren't you the same guy who wrote the legendary Ruby-based [Bukkit-izer](https://github.com/tangentialism/Bukkit-izer)?

Yesâ€”it's touching that you remember it! I obviously have a very narrow set of interests. Now you don't have to host anything.

### Why haven't you submitted this to `hubot-scripts`?

I don't know.
